#OBS:
A crude calculator made with js-html integration. only does the 4 basic operations. Has 2 places of input and all the results will be shown in the place of the green '0' number within the results area. The operations are also displayed in the console. also has a 'reset()' function that'll reset all the vars.

maybe i'll develop more advanced calculation in the future(probably near)
