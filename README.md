Hii, first of all this is a repo containing my work on studying software development.. 
Feel free to explore and analize it, but some code can be "childish" because i am a novice..
All my study work is divided by these folders, with anotations, some finished codes, and other things

This files should change in future, as i study more about brute programmation, 
and some theory too,
I feel i should also update it with some texts about some theory i've been studying too,
For examples OOP theorys like SOLID programming, composition, refactorization, dependency injection methods, etc.

Some updates will be gradually be updated here as i study more.
The updates are mainly comitted to the 'main' branch, and then pulled to the 'master' branch(After a major event happens). 
The more recent codes i'm writing shall be searched in the 'main' branch.
